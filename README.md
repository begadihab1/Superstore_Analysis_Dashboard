## 💡 Key Insights

### 1️⃣ Category Performance
- **Technology** leads in both sales (~$836K) and profitability  
- **Furniture** generates high sales but weaker profit margins  
- **Office Supplies** delivers moderate sales with more stable margins  

➡️ *Sales leadership does not always equal profit leadership.*

---

### 2️⃣ Customer Segment Analysis
- **Consumer segment** accounts for ~50% of total sales  
- **Corporate segment** contributes ~31% with more consistent profitability  
- **Home Office** represents ~19% of sales  

➡️ *Consumer drives volume, Corporate provides stability.*

---

### 3️⃣ Discount Impact
- Average discount is **16%**
- Higher discounts are correlated with lower profit per order
- Some sub-categories consistently generate losses due to discounting  

➡️ *Discounts increase volume but reduce profitability.*

---

### 4️⃣ Profit Efficiency
- **Profit per Order ($57)** provides clearer insight than total profit alone
- **Average Order Value ($459)** explains profitability differences across segments  

➡️ *Profit-based metrics are more actionable than sales totals.*
