🔍 What the Data Shows

Sales volume is strong, but profitability varies significantly

High sales do not always translate into high profit

Discounts play a major role in reducing profit

Performance differs widely across categories and segments

💡 Key Insights
1️⃣ Category Performance

Technology has the highest sales (~$836K) and the strongest profitability

Furniture generates substantial sales but contributes less profit

Office Supplies shows moderate sales with relatively stable margins

➡️ Sales leadership does not always equal profit leadership.

2️⃣ Customer Segments

Consumer segment accounts for ~50% of total sales

Corporate segment contributes ~31% and shows more consistent profitability

Home Office represents the smallest share (~19%)

➡️ Consumer drives volume, Corporate provides stability.

3️⃣ Discounts & Profitability

Average discount across orders is 16%

Higher discounts are associated with lower profit per order

Some products are consistently sold at reduced margins due to discounting

➡️ Discounting increases sales volume but erodes profit.

4️⃣ Profit Efficiency

Profit per Order ($57) highlights efficiency better than total profit alone

Average Order Value ($459) helps explain profitability differences across segments

➡️ Profit-focused metrics provide better business insight than sales alone.
